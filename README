This is an experimental distribution written in Perl 6

Before installation you'll have to have Parrot and Rakudo 
installed on your system, set the PARROT_DIR environment 
variable to the directory in which the parrot executable 
can be found and set the RAKUDO_DIR environment
variable to the directory where Rakudo (and thus perl6.pbc)
can be found.


Other than that normal Perl 5 installation process should
work so

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The files will be installed to the same place where the
Perl 5 modules are installed.

In order for your script to find the installed version of
your module you'll have to configure the PERL6LIB environment
variable to point to the directories where the normal 
perl 5 installation process will install your modules.

(See the @INC of your perl 5 using perl -V)
