This is an experimental distribution written in Perl 6

Before installation you'll have to have Parrot and Rakudo 
installed on your system and set the PARROT_DIR environment 
variable to the directory in which the parrot executable 
can be found.


Othat than that normal Perl 5 installation process should
work so

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


In order for your script to find the installed version of
your module you'll have to configure the PERL6LIB environment
variable to point to the directories where the normal 
perl 5 installation process will install your modules.

(See the @INC of your perl 5 using perl -V)
